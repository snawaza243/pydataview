# Data Visual

Thank you for choosing Data Visual! This is a Python desktop application that provides various features for statistical analysis of data, including measuring central tendency and dispersion, measuring distribution, and performing correlation analysis. The application also generates graphs to help visualize the data.

## Features

### Measuring Central Tendency and Dispersion

Data Visual allows you to measure central tendency and dispersion of your data. Here are the specific features:

- **Mean**: Find the arithmetic, harmonic, or geometric mean of your data.
- **Mode**: Identify the most common value in a data set.
- **Median**: Find the middle value in a set of data when the data is arranged in order.
- **Range**: Identify the spread of a data set by finding the difference between the largest and smallest values.
- **Coefficient of Variance**: Compare the variability of different data sets by calculating the standard deviation divided by the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: Identify how much the data deviates from the mean by calculating the square root of the variance.
- **Variance**: Identify how much the data deviates from the mean by calculating the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- **Quartile**: Identify the spread and distribution of a data set by finding values that divide the data into four equal parts.

### Measuring Distribution

Data Visual allows you to measure the distribution of your data using Poisson, Binomial, and Normal Distribution.

- **Poisson Distribution**: Use the Poisson distribution to model the occurrence of rare events.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Use the binomial distribution to model the probability of success or failure in a given situation.
- **Normal Distribution**: Use the normal distribution to model data that is normally distributed.

### Correlation Analysis

Data Visual allows you to analyze the correlation of two data sets.

### Graphs

Data Visual generates graphs to help visualize the data, including:

- **Bar Graphs**
- **Line Graphs**
- **Scatter Plots**

The graphs are created using the Matplotlib library.

## Technologies Used

Data Visual is built using the Python programming language, with various libraries and frameworks used for statistical analysis and graphing. The application uses:

- **NumPy** for numerical analysis
- **SciPy** for scientific computing
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for graphing
- **Tkinter** for creating the graphical user interface
